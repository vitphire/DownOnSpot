## Disclaimer

```text
DownOnSpot was not developed for piracy.
It is meant to be used in compliance with DMCA, Section 1201, for educational, private and fair use.
I am not responsible in any way for the usage of the source code.
```

## Building

Clone the repository using git and change to the local repository directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oSumAtrIX/DownOnSpot.git
cd DownOnSpot
```

A [private ssh key](https://osumatrix.me/ucp?get=free_librespot_private_key&token=fdfdbff6f5) is needed to use free Spotify accounts. 
Follow [this answer by DopeGhoti on stackexchange.com](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/494485) on how to set up ssh with the required private key.
A sample `~/.ssh/config` file could look like this:

```text
Host github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/free_librespot_private_key
```

If you do not want to use `free-librespot`, then remove the git dependency of `free-librespot`. 
For that, delete `git = "ssh://git@github.com/oSumAtrIX/free-librespot.git"` inside `Cargo.toml`.

`Nightly Rust` is required to build this project. Install it by following [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) instructions.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

If you get a linker error, you might need to download the [standard libmp3lame](https://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-libraries.php#libmp3lame) library.

## Usage/ Examples

Running DownOnSpot once will create the default configuration file in the same directory as your shell.

```bash
$ down_on_spot.exe
Settings could not be loaded, because of the following error: IO: NotFound No such file or directory. (os error 2)...
..but default settings have been created successfully. Edit them and run the program again.

$ down_on_spot.exe
Usage:
down_on_spot.exe (track_url | album_url | playlist_url | artist_url)
```
